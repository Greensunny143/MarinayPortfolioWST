                        I actually dont want to be an Officer because I know how hard its job can be.
                        But I always thought about stepping out of my comfort zone and try new things that can
                        help me grow. And so I did, Even with hesitation but with my friends words I was able to raise
                        my hands
                        and walk forward in front of every NSTP Students. Its very scary and my legs are trembling with
                        fear and
                        my legs became weak when its the speech part of the election. I swallowed my fear that time and
                        started
                        speaking and while looking at the other candidates, I feel so little because I can see in their
                        face and posture
                        they really do have the powerto became the president of the whole NSTP Students. Then the
                        picking started.
                        I was realy happy and a bit sad when I notice that the other candidate get a lot of vote. And I
                        thought that was over,
                        then the NSTP Coordinator said that there are 3 position of president and I was one of the 3
                        president that was selected and
                        later on, I just realized how good it is to step out of the comfort zone. I learned a lot of
                        thingsand experience a lot of things.
